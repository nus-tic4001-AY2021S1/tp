## **System design**
This section provides an overview of how the Money Tracker app is designed.

### Architecture
<br> <img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="800" /> <br>

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the Money Tracker App.

MoneyTracker is the `Main` class. It is responsible for:
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components.


The App consists of the following components.
* `UI`: The UI of the App.
* `Parser`: The parser executor.
* `Exception`: The exception executor.
* `Transaction`: Holds the transaction related records such as Category, Expense, Income.
* `Command`: The command executor.
* `Summary`: The summary executor and holds the Budget.
* `Storage`: Reads data from and writes data to the hard disk.

## Design & implementation of features
This section describes how certain features are designed and implemented.

### **Design & Implementation of add expense feature**
The add expense operation is implemented using `AddExpenseCommand`, which extends `Command`.
Upon receiving an input string that has `adde` as the first word, the `MoneyTracker` object will instantiate an
`AddExpenseCommand` object with the `fullCommand` string, which is the input entered by the user. The `MoneyTracker`
object will then call the `execute` method in the `AddExpenseCommand` object with the following arguments:
1. `transactions`: a `TransactionList` object;
2. `ui`: a `Ui` object;
3. `storage`: a `Storage` object;
4. `budget`: a `Budget` object;
5. `categories`: a `CategoryList` object.

Finally, the `execute` method will execute the following steps:
1. Calls `Parser#createExpense(fullCommand)` to get an `Expense` object `expense`;
2. Calls `transactions#addTransaction(expense, category)` to add `expense` to `transactions`;
3. Calls `storage#saveTransactions(transactions)` to save all transactions to text file;
4. Calls `ui#printAddTransaction(transactions)` to print out the details of `expense`.

The following sequence diagram shows the object interactions when the `MoneyTracker` object calls the `execute` method
of the `AddExpenseCommand` object:

### **Design of Command Component: List, ListCategory**
**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `list /cSalary`.

The *Class Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `list /cSalary`.
<br> <img src="images/ArchitectureClassDiagramListCommand.png" width="800" /> <br>

The Command Component: List, ListCategory
* can list `transaction` objects to users based on the command rules.
* can list `category` objects to users based on the command rules.



### **Implementation of Command Component: List, ListCategory**

### \[Enhanced\] list feature

#### Enhanced Implementation
The enhanced list feature was implement for *ListCommand*. It extends ListCommand with more *flexibility* and *variety*. The users can enter the list command to filter the result as what they require such as list by income category, by expense category, by year month, by type. Also, the order of filter condition is flexible. 


* `list /te`: Lists all expense categories.
* `list /m2020-09`: Lists all transaction happened in 2020 September.
* `list /cSALARY`: Lists all SALARY.
* `list /te /cfood /m2020-09`: Lists all Food expense happened in 2020 September
* `list /m2020-09 /te`: Lists all expense happened in 2020 September



These operations are exposed in the `ListCommand()` class.
* Step 1: The user executes list command. 
* Step 2: The ListCommand() class will parser the user instruction keywords and save as rules. 
* Step 3: Then check the rules one by one and return matched transaction records by calling the method `getFilteredList`
* Step 4: Display the matched transaction records to the user.


The following sequence diagram shows how the list operation works:

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a list command:
<br> <img src="images/ArchitectureActivityDiagramListCommand.png" width="800" /> <br>


#### Design consideration:
##### Aspect: How to check the list command rules

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use Streams filter to check the list command rules.
  * Pros: Streams can succinctly express quite sophisticated behaviour. It encourages looser coupling and less mutability. This is because it is a more declarative approach that tells the application what we want to achieve, not how we want to achieve it. Easy to implement by using streams filter.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage. Streams may be novel for some programmers.

* **Alternative 2:** Use “loop” and “if else” to check the list command rules.
  * Pros:  we are familiar with “loop” and “if else”. Will use less memory.
  * Cons: The logic of checking list command rules can become very complex, especially when there are multiple rules and order of rules is various every time. We must tell the application how we want to achieve based on the complex logic. We must ensure that the logic of checking can satisfy each case.


### **Design of Command Component: `report / report MONTH`**

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `report / report MONTH`.
<br> <img src="images/ArchitectureReportCommandSequencyDiagram.png" width="800" /> <br>

The *Class Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command ``report / report MONTH``.
<br> <img src="images/ArchitectureReportCommandClassDiagram.png" width="800" /> <br>

### **Implementation of Command Component: `report / report MONTH`**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### [Enhanced] `report / report MONTH` feature

#### Enhanced Implementation

The enhanced list feature was implement for *ReportCommand*. It extends ReportCommand with more *flexibility* and *variety*. The users can enter the report command to review the result as what their transactions detail such as month total expense , month total income, highest transactions by income / expense, highest category by income / expense category, highest frequency category by  income / expense  category.  Also, the last six months transactions report by income / expense.

- report:  the summary report for the last six months will be displayed.
- `report MONTH: the summary report for the specified month will  be displayed.

These operations are exposed in the `ReportCommand()` class.

- Step 1: The user executes report command.

- Step 2: The ReportCommand() class will parser the user instruction keywords and save as rules.

- Step 3: Then check the rules one by one and return matched transaction records by calling the method  printReportByMonth or printReport.

- Step 4: Display the matched transaction records and generate the summary report for the user.

  

#### Design consideration:

##### Aspect: How to check match every transactions to correct categories and generate the result with  descending order.

- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use Hashmap to match the  transactions to correct categories.
  - Pros: This enhancement needs to determine what category each transaction belongs to first, then use different category names as keys, and the sum of each transaction in the same category as the value to hashmap them and sort by value. Another function uses the number of transaction frequency in the same category as the value to hashmap and sort. And the clearly present the result in the monthly report.
  - Cons: Due to the fixed matching mode, the hash value must be related to the key properties, if the user requirements change, hashmap can not be flexible and simple to change their functions.
- **Alternative 2:** Use ArrayMap to replace Hashmap.
  - Pros: Use less memory compare with Hashmap, for example, use on Android apps.
  - Cons: Performance was slightly slowly than HashMap.
  
### **Implement of Function: `Summary`**

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user start the program and get the `Expense Summary`.
<br> <img src="images/ExpenseSummarySequenceDiagram.png" width="800" /> <br>

### [Enhanced] list feature

#### Enhanced Implementation

When the program started the ``Transaction`` will load the data store in data folder and put in arraylist, the ``Summary`` class will take 
the data from `Transaction` and use `LocalDate` libary to check if the data is within the Month. After take all the expense/income in the 
same month the `Ui` class will use `printSummary` function to display the monthly income/expense on welcome page.

These operations are exposed in the `Summary` class.

- Step 1: The user executes the program.

- Step 2: The ``Transaction`` class will load the user stored information from the file in data folder and put in array list.

- Step 3: Then the ``Summary`` class will take the data from the arraylist from ``Transaction`` and start to check the date.

- Step 4: Then ``Ui`` class will call the function `printSummary` to display the expense/income of the month on welcome page.

  

#### Design consideration:

##### Aspect: How to confirm the transaction in same month.

- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Loop transaction list and use getMonth() function to find transaction in same month as current month.
    -Pros: Use the arraylist to check one by one, the program is stable and clear in logic.
    -Cons: User will get a slightly slow loading time when the list is too big.
