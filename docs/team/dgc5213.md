## Project: Money Tracker

## Overview
Money Tracker is a CLI application that allows users to keep track of their income and expenses. Users can record their inflows and outflows of money and then view monthly reports of these movements of money.



### Summary of Contributions
Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to list commands.
  * What it does: allows the user to list the transaction records based on the different filters one at a time.
  * Justification: This feature improves the flexiblity of getting the desire result significantly because a user can have the flexiblity to excute different filters in various orders in list commands and the app should provide a convenient way to return the matched results.
  * Highlights: To enhance this program, the enhancement of using Streams filter to check the list command. Streams can succinctly express quite sophisticated behaviour. It encourages looser coupling and less mutability. This is because it is a more declarative approach that tells the application what we want to achieve, not how we want to achieve it. 
 

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to list category commands.
  * What it does: allows the user to list of all income and/or expense categories.
