## Objectives

A software Engineering project focusing on the implementation of a Green Field Project with an empahsis on Team work with different team members that adopts a software iterative approach to development. This software underwent 3 iteration during its development.

## Overview

### Project: IT logger

Developed using JAVA, IT Logger is a desktop app for managing software issues during development and production. It is used for tracking issue resolution from defect inception till resolution via a Command Line Interface (CLI).

It can be used for managing the Quality Control (QC) of different project during its SDLC.

It has features similar to most defect tracking softwares such as JIRA & HP ALM.

The project is built based on the User Story collected.

### Code Contributed

### Enhancements implemented:

Implemented the following function:

|Action|Format, Examples|
|--------|----------|
| list | ```list``` |
| Search| ```search /title /<title>``` <br> ```search /status /<status>``` <br>``` search /severity /<severityNum>``` <br> ```search /owner /<owner> ```<br> ```search /deadline /<deadlineDateString(dd-MM-yyyy)>``` |
  
 The ```list``` function was created to allow different users to view the total list of defects present in the IT Logger
 It was subsequently enhanced to perform listing based on different types & category such as severity, deadline and etc. It is a must have feature in for usage.
 
 The ```search``` function was created to allow users to look up all defects present in the IT Logger that meets certain search criteria. The list of which can be found   above.

### Contributions to documentation:

##### Contribution to the User Guide:

Assisted to produce the Feature & Command Summary Section.
Also Collaborated & Worked together with the team on the remaining parts of the UG. Jiancheng consolidated the submission to teams repo.

##### Contributions to the Developer Guide:

Assisted to upload members UML object diagram's, created description for the developer guide and created Class diagram to illustrate program for ```UI``` and ```Finder``` component. Added the implementation of ```search``` function and feature of ItLogger such as the description, sequence diagram & design consideration. 

Also Collaborated & Collaborated & Worked together with the team for the rest of the items. Jiancheng consolidated the remaning submission to teams repo.

### Contributions to team-based tasks :

 1. Setup the Repo in preparation for the project (e.g. creating the Repo, implementing Repo security setup, etc)
 2. Advising and reminding team to utilise project tools such as style guide checker to avoid Continuous Integration failure.
 3. Setting up of Team mile stone, creating incidents and moving User stories into them for easy tracking
 4. Perform basic manual testing during early stages of development. Raised bugs and issues.
 5. Contributed ideas during discussions in weekly meetings.
 6. Set forward each iteration task and planning to ensure smooth project progress.
 7. Perform code enhancement for Logging and Assertion.
 8. Assist to create the setup of additional Junit Testcases.

### Review/mentoring contributions: 

Assisted team members to resolve technical issue and provided articles to assist in their problem resolution within Team's internal chat.

### Contributions beyond the project team:

Motivated the team during weekly discussion by discussing about matters outside of project work to build and consolidate bond. Kept relationship healthy.
